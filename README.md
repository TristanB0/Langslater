# Langslater

**Langslater** is an open-source Discord Bot written in Python to translate messages which are not in a specified language. It uses the DeepL API for the translation and an SQLite database to store the language for each server.


## Features

* Select with a slash (/) command the language in which to translate the messages.
* Automatically translate messages into a selected language by replying to the user's original message.
